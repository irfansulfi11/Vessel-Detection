## 📝 Overview

Welcome to our **Ship Detection Project**, developed at the **Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE), DRDO**! This project harnesses the power of **YOLOv5** and **OpenCV** to create a robust system for detecting ships in complex maritime environments, advancing defense technology through cutting-edge **machine learning** and **computer vision**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **YOLOv5**: For real-time object detection to identify ships with high precision.
- **OpenCV**: For advanced image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **Python**: The backbone of our development pipeline.
- **Machine Learning & Computer Vision**: Core techniques for algorithm development.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Accurate Ship Detection**: Leverages YOLOv5’s deep learning capabilities to detect ships in challenging ocean conditions.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for speed and efficiency using OpenCV.
- **Scalable Design**: Built to adapt to various maritime surveillance scenarios.
- **Defense-Grade Reliability**: Engineered to meet the high standards of DRDO’s radar systems.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Maritime imagery is processed using OpenCV for noise reduction and feature enhancement.
2. **Object Detection**: YOLOv5 model detects ships with high accuracy, even in cluttered or low-visibility environments.
3. **Post-Processing**: Results are refined and visualized for real-time maritime monitoring.
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with radar systems for defense applications.
